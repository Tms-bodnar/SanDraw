<h2>Welcome to the home of sand drawing machine</h2>

### Idea
The idea came from the awesome  [Sisyphus table](https://sisyphus-industries.com)  <br>
I'm a DIY guy, and i thought, i can make it.

### Type

My solution for the problem is a [SCARA robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCARA), with two arms.

### Hardware

* Raspberry Pi 3A+
* Arduino Uno
* Protoneer CNC shield for Arduino Uno
* Stepper Motors
* Custom bearing base
* Slipring
* OpenBuilds v-slot profiles
* OpenBuilds gears and timing belt
* screws and parts from local DIY store

### Software

* Python 3.7
* Arduino IDE
* Accelstepper library
* [Sandify](https://sandify.org)

### First version, the whole system was on the rotor, didn' work as expected


### Thanks
